According to 2019 statistics from the Department of Motor Vehicles, approximately 27,000,000 people in California have drivers licenses, and around 36,500,000 registered vehicles (State of California Department of Motor Vehicles, n.d.). According to a report called Commuting by Public Transportation in the United States from the U.S. Census Bureau, a majority of people rely on their cars for daily commute (Burrows et al., 2021). With most people choosing to commute by car, it is no wonder that the citizens of California experience severe traffic congestion on a daily basis. Time issues: Travel times in California are increasing every year. According to census transportation data, the \\u201Cmean travel time to work\\u201D from 2015 to 2019 was 28.9 minutes (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This means that the average worker spent almost 30 minutes a day travelling only to work. This translates to an average of approximately 7200 minutes a year one way, or 14,400 minutes traveling to and from work. According to commute time statistics, \\u201CCommute times have continued to increase, with the average Bay Area commute taking 31 minutes in 2018\\u201D (Metropolitan Transportation Commission, n.d.). This translates to an average of approximately 7500 minutes a year commuting to or from work, or around 15,000 minutes traveling to and from work. Health and Environmental Issues: Traffic and traffic congestion can not only lead to frustration and delays, but can also have severe impacts on people\\u2019s health and the environment. In a study from UC Davis, for the National Center for Sustainable Transportation, data shows that \\u201CTraffic congestion degrades the air quality and threatens public health, especially for people living and working near major roadways\\u201D (UC Davis, n.d.). A decrease in air quality can lead to a variety of issues; from health problems like asthma, to environmental concerns such as global warming, all of these issues tie back to the release of CO2 emissions from driving.
