						<p>
							An effective solution to solve traffic congestion issues is to
							encourage more people to utilize public transport and carpool.
							Public transportation including using buses, trains, and also
							streetcars. Carpooling is when multiple people share a car to go
							to a certain destination. Carpooling is especially convenient
							because you and a friend or family member can travel together, and
							that will be one less car on the road. Whether it be to work,
							school, or even to buy groceries; carpooling is a very simple way
							to reduce the number of cars on the road. There are many benefits
							to using public transportation and carpooling.
						</p>
						<h2 class="font-weight-light">Health benefits</h2>
						<p>
							Taking public transport has a positive impact on health as it
							leads to an incidental increase in physical activity. According to
							the article, “Physical activity levels in American and Japanese
							men from the era-jump study and associations with metabolic
							syndrome”, the daily average steps for the citizens of Pittsburgh
							were approximately 7900, while the daily average for citizens of
							Kusatsu were approximately 9100 (Sagawa et al., 2020). A huge
							factor in the difference between Japanese and American daily step
							counts is Japanese people’s use of public transport. According to
							the Statistical Handbook of Japan 2021 “the Japan Railways (JR)
							group reported 9.50 billion passengers... Railways other than JR
							reported 15.69 billion passengers…[and commercial] buses
							transported 4.53 billion passengers in fiscal 2019” (Statistics
							Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, n.d.).
							According to the article “Physical Activity Associated with Public
							Transport Use—A Review and Modelling of Potential Benefits” from
							the MDPI, “In the US, 29 percent of those who use transit were
							physically active for 30 minutes or more each day (and considered
							as sufficiently active), solely by walking to and from public
							transit stops” (Rissel et al., 2012). Using public transport can
							help not only relieve traffic issues, but can also allow people to
							become stronger through incidental exercise.
						</p>
						<h2 class="font-weight-light">Environmental benefits</h2>
						<p>
							Using public transportation can drastically decrease the amount of
							CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. According to the Kansas City Area
							Transportation Authority “A single person who switches from a
							20-mile [commute] alone by car to existing public transportation,
							can reduce their annual CO2 emissions by 20 pounds per day, or
							more than 48,000 pounds in a year” (KCATA, n.d.). This will not
							only positively impact the environment by aiding in reducing
							global warming, but also humans and animals since the air will be
							less polluted.
						</p>
						<h2 class="font-weight-light">Safety</h2>
						<p>
							Using public transportation is an easy way to reduce the chances
							of accidents. According to a study by the American Public
							Transport Association, as explained by the Rail Passengers
							Association, “taking public transit, such as trains and buses,
							decreases the chances of an individual being in an accident by
							more than 90 percent when compared to driving” (2016). The website
							further explains that “According to the U.S. Department of
							Transportation, more than 35,000 people were killed on U.S. roads
							in 2015, an increase of 7.2 percent from 2014…” and “Taking a bus
							or train allows commuters to multitask, sleep or avoid driving
							drunk” (Rail Passengers Association, 2016). Especially for teens
							and elderly who might have trouble driving, it is important to
							rely more on public transportation in order to stay safe while
							travelling.
						</p>
						<h2 class="font-weight-light">Save time and money</h2>
						<p>
							Many people do not realize the amount of money wasted on fuel when
							going through traffic; just because someone is stopped in traffic
							does not mean they are saving fuel. Using public transport instead
							of cars to run errands or go to nearby locations will not only
							help reduce congestion, but it will also save you money. According
							to the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority in an article
							titled Environmental Benefits of Public Transit they state that
							“In 2011, U.S. public transportation use saved 865 million hours
							in travel time. Without public transportation, congestion costs in
							2011 would have risen by nearly $21 billion from $121 billion to
							$142 billion in 498 urban areas” (KCATA, n.d.). The article goes
							on to explain that “Public transportation use saves the U.S. the
							equivalent of 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline annually — and more
							than 11 million gallons of gasoline per day” (KCATA, n.d.). Using
							buses and trains can help save a lot of money as you cut back on
							weekly or bi-weekly fuel costs.
