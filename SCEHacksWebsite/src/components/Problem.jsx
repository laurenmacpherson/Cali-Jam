              In California, especially in the Bay Area, it’s very evident that
              traffic jams and traffic congestion are a huge issue. According to
              2019 statistics from the Department of Motor Vehicles,
              approximately 27,000,000 people in California have drivers
              licenses, and around 36,500,000 registered vehicles (State of
              California Department of Motor Vehicles, n.d.). According to a
              report called Commuting by Public Transportation in the United
              States from the U.S. Census Bureau, a majority of people rely on
              their cars for daily commute (Burrows et al., 2021). With most
              people choosing to commute by car, it is no wonder that the
              citizens of California experience severe traffic congestion on a
              daily basis. Time issues: Travel times in California are
              increasing every year. According to census transportation data,
              the “mean travel time to work” from 2015 to 2019 was 28.9 minutes
              (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). This means that the average
              worker spent almost 30 minutes a day travelling only to work. This
              translates to an average of approximately 7200 minutes a year one
              way, or 14,400 minutes traveling to and from work. According to
              commute time statistics, “Commute times have continued to
              increase, with the average Bay Area commute taking 31 minutes in
              2018” (Metropolitan Transportation Commission, n.d.). This
              translates to an average of approximately 7500 minutes a year
              commuting to or from work, or around 15,000 minutes traveling to
              and from work. Health and Environmental Issues: Traffic and
              traffic congestion can not only lead to frustration and delays,
              but can also have severe impacts on people’s health and the
              environment. In a study from UC Davis, for the National Center for
              Sustainable Transportation, data shows that “Traffic congestion
              degrades the air quality and threatens public health, especially
              for people living and working near major roadways” (UC Davis,
              n.d.). A decrease in air quality can lead to a variety of issues;
              from health problems like asthma, to environmental concerns such
              as global warming, all of these issues tie back to the release of
              CO2 emissions from driving. If traffic issues in California are
              not solved in due time, they can lead to an array of issues for
              the citizens, from health concerns to travel delays, to
              environmental degradation.
